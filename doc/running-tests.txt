Notes for running tests

(these are some personal notes for testing)

Smoke test for unpacking
------------------------

To run a smoke test for unpacking with a large collection of firmwares it is
important to do the following:

* set 'cleanup' to yes so the disk doesn't fill up with unpacking directories
* set 'writeoutputfile' to 'no' so the disk doesn't fill up with result files
* disable ranking so the database is not hit (taking a long time)
