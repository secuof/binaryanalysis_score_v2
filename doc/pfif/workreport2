Work Report milestone 2 ("Processing Java class files for better extracting of strings for the ranking module")


The milestone "Processing Java class files for better extracting of strings for the ranking module" was performed between October 19 and November 23. In this period the following was done:

* the data model from the ranking database was changed to take programming languages into account by adding a new field "language"
* a public domain third party tool to process files for Android's Dalvik ("dedexer") was added to the bat-extratools collection
* wrapper code was written to process output from jcf-dump (for regular Java class files) and dedexer (for Dalvik files)
* a database consisting of code from the Apache project was generated and made available for download to PFIF
