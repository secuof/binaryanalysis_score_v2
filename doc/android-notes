Unpacking Android things

  File systems in use:

* yaffs2 (use unyaffs for this, although this will not always work)
* ubifs (seen one example so far that had broken images)
* ext4 (soon, according to post that Ted Ts'o once did)
* possibly other file systems too

All kinds of meta info in boot.img files:

  Location of standard license texts

After unpacking firmware often a copy of the default Google terms of service can be found in /etc/NOTICE.html.gz. Sometimes additional files with extra license texts can be found.
