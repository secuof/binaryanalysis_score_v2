This directory contains a few patches that need to be applied to programs before they can be reliably used by BAT

* cramfs.patch : this patch enables the -x option and removes the unpacking of special inodes, such as device files. Creating these files sometimes requires root privileges. This means that BAT would have to run as root. Since these special files are not inspected anyway there is no need to unpack them.

* code2html-0.9.1-add-qml.patch : this patch lets code2html also process QML files (more and more frequently used in Qt programs)

* code2html-0.9.1-add-groovyscala.patch : this patch lets code2html also process Scala and Groovy files as Java


* code2html-0.9.1-add-csharp.patch : this patch lets code2html process C# files. It is a direct copy of the Java config, with a few minor modifications
