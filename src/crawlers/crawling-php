Crawling PHP's PEAR and PECL repositories

PHP has an extension mechanism with which packages can be downloaded and
installed, called 'pear'. Various 'channels' (or repositories) can be
configured, like PEAR, PECL and more.

The packages are downloaded, built (if needed) and installed on the system.
The pear command also has an option to download packages. To download all
packages there is a convenient 'download-all' option.

For PEAR use:

$ pear download-all

For PECL use:

$ pecl download-all

By default only packages marked as 'stable' will be downloaded. To download
other packages you can set the preferred_state, for example:

$ pear config-set preferred_state alpha
$ pear config-set preferred_state beta
$ pear config-set preferred_state devel

Please note: not all distributions build PHP with the pear command (for example
Fedora does not) because it means that some packages will be installed outside
the control of the system package manager which can lead to a sysadmin
nightmare. You might need to build and install PHP as a normal user somewhere
before being able to run the commands mentioned above.
